## Automated Reasoning university project

Code and material for the Automated Reasoning class of Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity master degree corse of Universit√† degli Studi di Udine.

This repo contains my notes and gathered/generated material for the project, as well as an ASP (Clingo) and a Minizinc implementation.
**Note that I'm far for being an expert of such languages, so use the code with discretion!**
